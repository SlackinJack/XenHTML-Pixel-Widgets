# XenHTML-Pixel-Widgets

**Working: Most likely**

Ports of the Google Pixel lockscreen clock and "At a Glance" widget to XenHTML.

**Installation:**
Copy project folders to any of the following locations:
*/private/var/mobile/Library/Widgets/Backgrounds*
*/private/var/mobile/Library/Widgets/Homescreen*
*/private/var/mobile/Library/Widgets/Lockscreen*
*/private/var/mobile/Library/Widgets/Universal*

(Might consider packaging into a .deb later. For now, it is not a priority in any shape or form.)
