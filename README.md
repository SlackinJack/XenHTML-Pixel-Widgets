# XenHTML-Pixel-Widgets

**Working: Most likely**

Ports of the Google Pixel lockscreen clock and "At a Glance" widget to XenHTML. Includes basic locale settings.

**Installation:**
Copy project folders to */private/var/mobile/Library/Widgets/Universal* on your iDevice or anywhere else XenHTML can see it.
(Might consider packaging into a .deb later. For now, it is not a priority in any shape or form.)
